= Update Script for DynV6 on EdgeOS

This script updates IPv6 Address and Prefix of a link:https://dynv6.com[dynv6] zone to the ones configured.

It can handle the interface as first argument. If none is given, it will take the first interface configured for dyndns.
Access token and zone are taken from the first dyndns service of that first dyndns interface.
It gets the IP from the interface and calculates the subnet from the first interface configured for PD.

== Installation

. Download dynv6.sh to /config/scripts on the router.
. Set options of the dyndns config to postscript=/config/scripts/dynv6.sh .
